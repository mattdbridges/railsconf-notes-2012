# Railsconf: Monday Morning Keynote

## Speaker: DHH

The reason we are all still here is because of the progress we continue to make.

### Do you like progress?

* We like things that makes our world better and easier!
* Asking if we like progress is like asking if anyone likes parfays.

### How much do you *really* like progress?

* REST
* Ruby 1.9 (progress-smogress)
* Bundler (clapping!!!!)
* Rails 3
* Asset Pipeline
* Coffeescript

### "The old one was better"

Lots of people like 'the old one better'.

### Not all lforward movement is progress

* Lots of things you can add just add drag.
* `1:56.3` => `1:57.8` => Not a good change
* `1:56.3` => `1:54.4` => Good change!

Example of progress:

```ruby
# Old
Person.find(:conditions => { :name => "David" })

# New
Person.where(name: "David")
```

* **Skepticism is OK!**
* Curious -> Suspicious

When does the switch from curious to suspicious happen? This switch is not good for the community.

    A conservative is a liberal who got mugged.

    Everyone likes the cutting edge until they cut themselves.

These lost data, introduced a bug, upgrading took longer than expected.
No one *likes* to lose data!

This scenario is a hinderance to progress.

1. Why did you change the system!?
2. It was working before!
3. "If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"
4. THIS CAN NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN!

    We tried progress. It did not work!

### Growing old
* Getting old just follows with not liking change.
* It has to do with mental patterns that we get used to.
* Change is good when you are young! You are in the perfect curious state!
* OSS => Free love! Free code!
* A few might hold on to early ideals. Hippies are now pretty rare.
* Hippies, lots of times, turn into *Mr. Mature*.
* Mr. Mature has something to lose.
* "I know how things are. Don't tell me how to do things."
* Do not rock the boat to much!

Curious -> Suspicious in the coding world takes 3-5 years.
Curious -> Supsicious is usually a one way street.

    Loss aversion is the pillar of conservatism. -DHH

* Turning technology into "Easy Bake".
* An oven does the same thing even though it is a little "dangerous".

#### Progress can be hard!

* If we dumb everything down for the newbies, they will not be learning real skills.
* Learning real skills requires taking risks!
* Learn something that is useful and real to make proress.

#### There is no speed limit to learning!

    The pace was intense, and I loved it. Finallly, someone was challenging me - keeping me in over my head- encouraging and expecting me to pull mysef up, quickly.

* Learning like Mr Dummy is not a good way learn anything!

### Loss aversion.

* People hate losing anything.
* Do not be stuck being loss averse.
* If you have a different frame of mind, you could be much less risk and loss averse.
* Be willing to reframe your mind to be a pioneer.

### Great products are made by people who use them

* "I only care about tools I actually use." -DHH
* "Progress is painful." -DHH
* Progress hurts a lot less if you accept that it is goign to be painful.

    Rails 4 will change things, break things

Now that we know, we can layer some cognitive response on top of it.

    I will not fear change, I will not fight progress. -DHH

* Stay young.
* Stay curious.
* Stay hippie.
