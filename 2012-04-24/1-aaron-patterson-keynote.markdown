    I've made a huge mistake!

### Tokaido: Binary distribution of Ruby for Mac OS X

Excited for the following:

* Students
* Teachers
* _All_ Developers

    How important is ___your time___?

### Failure to Evolve

* _Concurrency_
* _Producer Consumer_
* Why do we have __ActionMailer__, but no __Queue__?

    Interface is __Most Important__!
    Implementation is __secondary__.

##### Who is the __driving force__?

### Failure to Lead

__Fear of Features__

* Cost = Dev Time + Maintenance
* Tolerance = Value / Time
* New developers are __more likely__ to click the __merge__ button.


### Features

* Cosmetic
* Refactoring
* Course Correcting

#### 1. Cosmetic Features: __Dubious Value__ and __Unknown Debt__

* __-> Tagged Logging__
* Initial Implementation: __Not Thread Safe__ and __Incompatible__
  * [why] [do] [we] [need] this?

#### 2. Refactoring Features: __High Value__ and __Low Debt__

#### 3. Course Correction: __High Value__ and __Unknown Debt__

* Asset Pipeline
* Computation Distribution
  * __Centralized__
  * __Distributed__: PC
  * __Centralized__: Browser => Server
  * __Distributed__: JS + Browser
* Asset Pipeline: __Too Big to Fail__
* There is no __Bail-Out__.
* We need to __be prepared__.

### Takeaways

1. Same Interface between implementations
